> Mama, do you see what I see
> On your knees and pray for me
> Mathilde's come back to me
> Charley, don't want another beer
> Tonight I'm gonna drink my tears
> Mathilde's come back to me
> Go ask the maid if she heard what I said
> Tell her to change the sheets on the bed
> Mathilde's come back to me
> Fellas, don't leave me tonight
> Tonight I'm going back to fight
> Wretched Mathilde's in sight

> My heart, my heart, stop beating so
> Just make as if you didn't know
> That Mathilde's come back to me
> My heart, I don't want you to say
> She's lovelier than when she went away
> Mathilde, who's come back to me
> My heart, stop beating overjoyed
> Remember you were once destroyed
> By Mathilde, who's come back to me
> Fellas, please don't go away
> Tell me that I mustn't stay
> Mathilde's coming back today

> My hands, you'll start to shake again
> When you remember all the pain
> Mathilde's come back to me
> You'll want to beat her black and blue
> But don't do it, I beg of you
> Mathilde's come back to me
> My hands, remember all the years
> Remember when you caught my tears
> Mathilde's come back to me
> My hands, you'll want to touch her now
> But please try and be strong somehow
> Mathilde's here, she's coming now, now

> Mama, can you hear me yell
> Your baby boy's gone back to hell
> Mathilde's come back to me
> Charley, champagne right away
> I know you've been saving it for the holiday
> But Mathilde's come back to me
> Go ask the maid if she heard what I said
> Tell her to put the best sheets on the bed
> Mathilde's come back to me
> My friends, don't count on me no more
> I've gone and crashed through heaven's door
> My sweet Mathilde's here
> Once more, once more
